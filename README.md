# Tangelo-2.3.1

## Introduction

Tangelo is a single file compressor (not an archiver) which was derived from PAQ8 by Matt Mahoney and has existed in multiple versions since 2013, seeking a balance between high compression ratios and speed.

This version of Tangelo is benchmarked against the [enwik8 dataset](https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/textdata.html) and, for reference, the dataset is included in this repository.
